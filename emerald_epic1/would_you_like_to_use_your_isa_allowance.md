# Would you like to use your ISA allowance?

[] **Yes** <br />

[] **No** <br />
You can still invest in our funds if you’ve already invested your allowance this tax year. 

[Need help deciding?](ww.)<br />
You don’t pay income tax or capital gains tax when you save or invest in an ISA. Any profit or income is exempt, and you don’t have to include ISA investments in your tax returns.  Your ISA allowance for this tax year is £20,000.  If you’ve already used it up, you can still invest in our funds. You just don’t get the same tax benefits.
