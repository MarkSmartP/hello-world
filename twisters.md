| How would you like to invest?    | Need help deciding? | You can potentially increase the long-term fund value through reinvestment, or pay yourself a regular income from any returns. Simply choose the option that best suits your needs. |
| Would you like to use your ISA allowance?    | Need help deciding?      |   You don’t pay income tax or capital gains tax when you save or invest in an ISA. Any profit or income is exempt, and you don’t have to include ISA investments in your tax returns.  Your ISA allowance for this tax year is £20,000.  If you’ve already used it up, you can still invest in our funds. You just don’t get the same tax benefits.  |
